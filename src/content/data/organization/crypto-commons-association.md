## About Crypto Commons Association

The **Crypto Commons Association** (CCA) is a non-profit collective, hosted on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/cca). It promotes the general development of Crypto Commons infrastructures mainly through research and events, while supporting the growing community of commoners who seek value beyond speculation in crypto technologies!

## Purpose

The objective of CCA is to foster and grow a **community of commoners** — people who believe in the beauty and strength of public goods — regarding the themes of cryptographic technology, be it cryptocurrencies or blockchain.

To do this, CCA has hosted many different events ranging from large community gatherings (CCG: Crypto Commons Gathering) to events only tangentially related to crypto tech, such as RECL[AI]M (focusing on AI technology and its implications) and various Solarpunk events (focusing on the value of finding commonality between sustainable agriculture and IoT technology).

## QUESTIONS!

---

## How do you plan to incorporate BREAD in your org?

> [!important] CCA already incorporates BREAD whenever possible by hosting events and often
> 
> **discussing about it and presenting it** to members of the community and new ones alike who don’t know about Bread Cooperative.
> 
> Furthermore, CCA directly incorporates BREAD by allowing **payment for the minimum contribution to participate in its events through BREAD**, strengthening the funding pool!

## What do you plan to do in the short term with the funds received from Bread Cooperative?

> [!important] CCA’s main costs derive from payment of its core team, in the short term funding from Bread Cooperative helps us cover wages and living costs, together with organizational costs such as event venues or services we need for our work.

## ==What processes do you have to determine how funds from Bread Cooperative are allocated?==

_==e.g., proposals, directly to contributors, etc.==_

> [!important] CCA currently has no articulate mechanism for allocating funds, as the revenues right now mostly cover operating costs. With the expansion of Bread Cooperative, our objective is to use our platform to integrate specific areas and funding pools, so that members of our community can vote on which should receive part of the funding generated by Bread Cooperative (eg. a pool dedicated to the organization of events on specific thematics such as Collaborative Finance or Regenerative Finance).

## What have you done so far with the funds you've received?

> [!important] Thanks to everyone who [voted](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/BMIPx1uJozXLoSTY1bBq5ua6X3qS8qZf5rXUC_fKdjo) for us in the first round and distribution cycle! Funds have gone to cover the costs of our team and project, and also to help us finance the Commons Economy Roadmap (you can read more on this in the “Associated Projects” section).
