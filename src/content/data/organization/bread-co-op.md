## About Bread Core Team

The Bread Core Team team includes the developers and designers of Bread Cooperative applications as well as the stewards of the online community. The Bread Core Team team builds Solidarity Primitives - development tools which help to forge solidarity between individuals and collectives. The first solidarity primitive created by the Bread Cooperative is the [[wiki/about/bread-token/index|$BREAD Token]] found on the [Bread Crowdstaking Application](https://app.breadchain.xyz/) built on top of Gnosis Chain.

The Core team’s work is both technical by building smart contracts and applications to be used by the member projects and its supporters as well as social by making space the human coordination necessary for growing the project. If you want to engage and help, be sure to sign up in the [contributor pipeline](https://forms.gle/UU4FmHq4CZbiEKPc6) form.

## Purpose

The purpose of the core team is to ensure there is an organized dedicated group building key infrastructure deemed necessary for the growth and financial sustainability of the project. The core areas of competency for the core team include:

- All on-chain infrastructure for the BREAD token, monthly voting cycles, and BREAD distribution to Bread member projects
- Designing and deployment of user interfaces for BREAD holders to interact with Bread Cooperative applications
- Building new solidarity primitives to be adopted into the core infrastructure
- Facilitating the cryptoleftists online community to grow and share resources that can be used to further the goals of building post-capitalism in web3

## QUESTIONS!

---

## How do you plan to incorporate BREAD in your org?

> [!important] The BREAD token is fundamental in our organization as it is the only token we use to pay wages to core members. The vast majority if not all assets owned by the core team is held in BREAD as a way to continue growing the pot of solidarity whether the funds come from Gitcoin rounds or elsehow.

## What do you plan to do in the short term with the funds received from Bread Cooperative?

> [!important] In the short term we will be using the funds to continue paying out wages to the core members so that they can feel secure in dedicating time towards working on the project. We will also use the funds for paying for miscellaneous costs for helping core members travel or attend important events and infrastructural costs around hosting and refunds if needed.

## ==What processes do you have to determine how funds from Bread Cooperative are allocated?==

_==e.g., proposals, directly to contributors, etc.==_

> [!important] For wages we create monthly spending limits for specific members in the Safe wallet core members are all a part of so that they can withdraw their monthly wage when convenient for them. Wages are determined through social consensus within the group where we first map out the current state of the treasury and forecast our runway to determine what are appropriate amounts to pay each member. Other expenses are paid through requests made by core members which are majority vote approved.

## What have you done so far with the funds you've received?

> [!important] So far we have been paying wages to core members who have expressed the need for financial compensation for the past several months and are dedicated to making sure that this continues for the foreseeable future. Funds have also been used to pay for hosting costs necessary around hosting and subscription costs for necessary tooling to help the work of core members.
