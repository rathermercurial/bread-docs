## BASICS

## About Citizen Wallet

Citizen Wallet, offers communities the web 3 tools they need to easily launch, use and manage community currencies.

So far we have built:

- Easy-to-use wallet native mobile app that takes away all the complexity of Web 3 (no gas fees, no configuration)
- transaction monitoring dashboards
- NFC wallet solution for a simple tap-to-pay or tap-to-earn in-person transactions
- Administration dashboard with simple flow to create token faucets for easy distribution.
- Dedicated Point of Sale application to accept tokens in shops.

Currently, people can already use the Citizen Wallet to manage and use their $BREAD tokens. Through an easy onboarding process, users can create a wallet, send and receive tokens.

  

## Purpose

Give citizens the tools they need to build resilient and regenerative communities.

Make it easy for any community to create their own currency to facilitate exchanges with and within their community, and allocate resources to fund their public goods.
