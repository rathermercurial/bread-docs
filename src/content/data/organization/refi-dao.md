## About ReFi DAO

ReFi DAO is a global network working to drive the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement, leveraging Web3 to facilitate the regeneration of Earth’s ecosystems and foster economic systems that prioritize ecological and social well-being. Through decentralized coordination, community-driven initiatives, and the development of public goods, ReFi DAO empowers regenerative projects and communities worldwide to connect, collaborate, and scale their impact.

  

## Purpose

ReFi DAO’s global mission is to regenerate the Earth by fostering a **regenerative economy** rooted in decentralized collaboration, community empowerment, and ecological restoration at local, bioregional, and global scales. To achieve this, we aim to scale the **ReFi movement**, empowering individuals and communities to co-create a sustainable, equitable, and thriving future.

We envision a new paradigm where local communities and global networks unite to regenerate the Earth.

## QUESTIONS!

---

## How do you plan to incorporate BREAD in your org?

> [!important] We plan to integrate
> 
> **BREAD** into ReFi DAO’s ecosystem by promoting BREAD within the local node network and broader community. We aim to facilitate campaigns and actions that drive BREAD’s usage, fostering collaboration, economic relations, and solidarity throughout the network.

  

## What do you plan to do in the short term with the funds received from Bread Cooperative?

> [!important] In the near term, we plan to allocate Bread Cooperative funds to cover operational needs in Q1 ’25 as part of a larger ReFi DAO 2.0 budget and financial plan. This plan will be ratified by DAO members once the appropriate mechanisms are rolled out in January ’25.
> 
> Future initiatives include:
> 
> - Supporting local node pilots that integrate BREAD, enabling small-scale experiments in regenerative finance.
> - Co-launching community campaigns that align ReFi DAO and Bread Cooperative values (e.g., ReFi, post-capitalist initiatives, and building dual power).

  

## ==What processes do you have to determine how funds from Bread Cooperative are allocated?==

ReFi DAO follows a **consent-based governance** model where proposals are openly shared for community feedback. As ReFi DAO 2.0 is implemented, the allocation of Bread Cooperative funds will be incorporated into the financial plan, the first of which, covering H1 ’25, will be ratified by DAO members in January ’25.

  

## What have you done so far with the funds you've received?

> [!important] Currently, ReFi DAO has not yet received BREAD funding.
