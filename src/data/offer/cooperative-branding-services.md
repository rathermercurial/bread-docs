## Pricing Philosophy

I use sliding scale pricing to make design accessible:

- **Grassroots/Mutual Aid**: $50-75/hour
- **Established Cooperatives**: $75-100/hour
- **Project-Based**: Fixed quotes for defined scopes

**Payment Options**:
- Standard payment (check, PayPal, Venmo)
- Crypto accepted (ETH, USDC)
- Barter/time banking considered for mutual aid groups

## Process

1. **Discovery**: Understanding your organization and goals
2. **Research**: Exploring your community and values
3. **Concepts**: Multiple design directions to explore
4. **Refinement**: Collaborative iteration
5. **Delivery**: Final files + brand guidelines
6. **Support**: 30 days of revisions included
