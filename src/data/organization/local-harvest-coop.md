# Local Harvest Food Cooperative

## About

Local Harvest is a member-owned food cooperative serving our community with locally-sourced, organic produce and groceries. We work directly with regional farmers and food producers to create a sustainable local food system.

## Our Story

Founded in 2018, Local Harvest emerged from a community desire for access to healthy, locally-produced food at fair prices. We operate as a multi-stakeholder cooperative with both consumer and worker members.

## What We Offer

- **Fresh Produce**: Organic fruits and vegetables from local farms
- **Grocery Items**: Locally-produced pantry staples, dairy, and dry goods
- **CSA Program**: Community Supported Agriculture boxes delivered weekly
- **Wholesale**: Bulk produce for restaurants and institutions

## Cooperative Values

- Support local and regional farmers
- Provide fair wages to worker-members
- Make healthy food accessible to all community members
- Build economic democracy through cooperative ownership
- Environmental sustainability in all operations

## Membership

- **Consumer Members**: $100 equity share, 10% discount on purchases
- **Worker Members**: Profit-sharing and democratic workplace governance
- **Producer Members**: Guaranteed markets and fair prices for farmers

## Relationship with Breadchain

Local Harvest is a member project of the Breadchain Cooperative network, receiving support through the BREAD token economic system and participating in mutual aid networks.
